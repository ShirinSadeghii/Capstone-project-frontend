# Project Title
Thynk Travel 

## Overview
What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.
I will be creating a full-stack application that will be a "one stop shop" for for organizing/planning trips. The app will provide users the ability to view current deals on flights and hotels in any area they wish to travel to, and then after booking their trip, they will be able to browse through local activities/sightseeing spots in that area and plan out their itenerary as sort of a daily planner. 

### Problem
Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

The travel industry is one of the largest service industries in the world and there are almost an infinite number of websites and apps that people can use to browse for travel and/or flight deals, and even though over the years browsing for the best deal on the web has gotten perhaps a bit easier with websites that compare prices across different domains. There is still alot of prepping, planning and organizing that goes into travelling. So with this being said, the focus of this app will be to provide users with a platform that not only acts as a deal finder on flights/hotels but users can also browse for things to do in their destination and then plan out their daily iteneraries based on their findings. So essentially this app will combine a travel deal finder and a daily planner in one. 

### User Profile
Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

My app will be used by ideally by individuals who are in a younger age demographic, because they are the ones who are more tech savy, but also prefer the concept of independent travel (as opposed to individuals who prefer using travel agencies). In terms of how a user will use the app, I will be creating a user login system where first time users can create an account and being searching for flights and/or hotels. 



### Features
List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.




## Implementation

### Tech Stack
List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

I will be using MySQL for building rational database, Express.js for Backend framework, React.js for Frontend framework and Node.js for runtime environment. I'm not quite sure of what libraries I will be using within React and Express. 

### APIs
List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.
I will be using Hotelapi.co API for getting real-time pricing on hotels and flightapi.io API for real-time pricing on flights (one-way, round-trip or multi-trip flights). I'm not sure about the API for incorporating sightseeing in the area that the user will book their destination yet. Will have to look further into that. 

### Sitemap
List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

I want to have multi-pages, one will be for users profile, where they can save their preferances, and have a section on previous trips booked, one page will be dedicated for browsing hotels, another will be dedicated for finding flights, one page will be for browsing local things to do, sightsee, etc in the area based off either the user inputting the area as a search parameter or based off the users booking and then finally the last page will be a daily planner where users can map out and plan their daily activities while on their trip. 



### Mockups
Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches. 

I will provide mockups of my app at a later date as I have not sketched out what I want my UI to look like.

### Data
Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out. 

Not sure about the data and relationships at this time. Will leave this blank for now. 

### Endpoints
List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

I'm not sure of the endpoints or HTTP methods just yet at this stage of my proposal. But I know I will be using GET HTTP method to retrieve data from the API.

### Auth
Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

Yes my project will include a login, which will be implemented by setting a default token. 

## Roadmap
Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

Once I have all my details from the above points in a more refined manner then I can have a more sensible idea of how to map out my project into sprints. Ideally I will break down my work into two sprints. One with a deadline for Sunday, Nov 19th and the second sprint deadline will be Sunday, Nov 26th. 


## Nice-to-haves
Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.
